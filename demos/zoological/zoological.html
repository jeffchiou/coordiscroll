<h5 class="lg150 gsp">PREFACE.</h5>

<h5><img src="images/separator.png" class="middle" style="height:1.5ex;" alt="" /></h5>

  <p>The termination of the first volume of the Zoological Illustrations is
  accomplished, and its contents will not only enable our readers to
  discern the nature of the work, but likewise to form a judgement, on that
  degree of improvement which we have introduced since its first
  publication, and they may safely rely on the continuation being in no
  respect inferior.</p>

  <p>In commencing a work of this nature, we have had two principal objects
  in view: the diffusion of original observations, which, while they might
  further the ends of science, would also be interesting to the general
  reader; and that of discouraging the publication of distorted figures
  copied from old authors, by accustoming the public eye to original
  designs and correct representations of natural objects. How far we may
  have succeeded in this latter object, remains to be judged by others; we
  are however satisfied with having made the attempt, and we hope that
  abler pencils than our own, may engage in the prosecution of this most
  desirable object; for it is only by the publication of original matter,
  that a check can be given to the increasing number of compilations and
  multiplied copies of "ill-shaped" figures, by which error is perpetuated,
  and science retarded.</p>

  <p>The only original work that has appeared in this country similar to
  our own, is the Zoological Miscellany by Dr. Leach, which, as it was
  discontinued after the third volume, it may be presumed was unsuccessful:
  although little can be said of many of the figures in the early volumes,
  those in the latter are much to be praised, and the whole are original;
  the descriptions also abound with details highly interesting to the
  scientific world, for which indeed the learned author principally
  intended it; nevertheless it is a question, whether science in the end
  would not have been equally, and perhaps more advanced, had this work
  been more adapted to general readers. Instruction in these days of
  refinement must be made easy, palatable, and enticing; the eye must be
  pleased, while the understanding is improved, and Wisdom in her simple
  dignified garb will often be deserted for Ignorance, decked out in the
  glittering trappings of Folly.</p>

  <p>The <i>Naturalist's Miscellany</i> conducted by Dr. Shaw, in its
  miscellaneous nature also resembled the present work, and reached to the
  extent of twenty-four volumes. What an invaluable fund of information
  these might have contained had their contents been original!
  Unfortunately, however, the exceptions are so few, that the whole may be
  termed a loose compilation, the descriptions being mostly given in as few
  words as possible, and the figures not only copied from wretched
  representations found in old authors, but often coloured from their
  descriptions only! It is indeed lamentable that the Author, whose talents
  and abilities were unquestionable, should have exerted them so little,
  and thus have descended to the rank of a voluminous compiler, for little
  better can be said of the General Zoology, begun and continued under his
  name: little original matter can there be found, excepting in the latter
  volumes, yet even in these no notice whatever is taken of the immense
  number of new species discovered in Africa by Le Vaillant, and long ago
  published in the <i>Oiseaux d'Afrique</i>: the engravings also are in
  like manner copied from old prints, enlarged or diminished as occasion
  offers, without even a regard to the selection of the best. It may be as
  well to observe in this place, that a great number of generic
  distinctions have been made in the two last volumes; which, as they have
  not been followed by any of the great and acknowledged Zoologists on the
  Continent, and appear to us in many instances trivial and unnecessary,
  will not be adopted in this work.</p>

  <p>It will be unnecessary to point out with regard to the scientific
  arrangement, that we have avowedly adopted the principles of the modern
  classification; which the strict followers of Linn�us (in this country
  alone) have so long, but so ineffectually opposed. The first has been
  designated as the natural, and the other the artificial system; and,
  without entering into a critical disquisition on these definitions, it
  will be sufficient to observe, that by the Artificial System we bend
  nature to conform to certain arbitrary principles, which we lay down and
  to which we insist all her productions known and unknown will conform;
  while in the Natural method, we endeavour by tracing her modifications,
  to adapt our system to that which appears to regulate her operations. In
  the one we give laws, in the other receive them; by the first we are
  taught to believe that the highest attainment of the science, is that of
  ascertaining the name of an object in our Museum, or of giving a new one;
  we record it in our favourite system as a grammarian enters a new word in
  his dictionary, and there the matter terminates. Where the artificial
  system ends, the natural begins; for we then proceed to the investigation
  of affinities founded on anatomical construction, economy, and geographic
  distribution; our attention ceases to be confined to individuals, and
  extends to large groups; general facts enable us to draw general
  conclusions, till the mind begins faintly to discern a vast and mighty
  plan, by which the zones of the earth are peopled by their own respective
  races of animate beings; blending their confines unto each other with
  divine harmony, beauty, and usefulness.</p>

  <p>That these inquiries and results have had a most wonderful effect on
  the natural sciences of late years, is abundantly evident. Geology, a
  subject hardly thought of in this country a few years ago, is now found
  to be a science of the first importance; with this, however, Conchology
  is so intimately connected, that without a certain knowledge of it, the
  geologist is frequently unable to prosecute inquiries of the most
  interesting nature; and there is little doubt but that Botany has been
  raised to the rank it now so justly holds, solely because its natural
  system has been more generally studied and advocated in this country,
  than that of any other branch of Natural History. In this science at
  least, we possess a superiority which our continental neighbours cannot
  dispute; and the name of Brown will be enrolled in the brightest page of
  our philosophic inquirers.</p>

  <p>That the prejudiced adherence to the strict Linn�an system, has been
  the primary cause why Zoology has been more neglected with us than on the
  Continent, will admit of little doubt; for by shutting the door to all
  further improvement, it has impressed the generality of our countrymen
  with an idea, that the highest object of the Naturalist was to label the
  contents of a museum, and to arrange stuffed animals, like quaint
  patterns of old china, in glass cases: to thinking minds no less than to
  the vulgar, this idea has produced a feeling of contempt and ridicule,
  and very few of those qualified by nature for accurate investigation and
  philosophic reasoning, have been induced to make the science a study; and
  thus from such an unfortunate prejudice, to use the words of a powerful
  writer of the present day, "some future historian of the progress of
  human knowledge, will have to state that England, till within the few
  last years, stood still at the bottom of the steps where Linn�us had left
  her; while her neighbours were advancing rapidly towards the entrance of
  the temple<a name="NtA_1" href="#Nt_1"><sup>[1]</sup></a>."</p>

  <p>Finally&mdash;Linn�us to a comprehensive genius united indefatigable
  industry; yet he could not see and study those innumerable productions
  that have been discovered since his death: in proportion as our knowledge
  of objects increases, so must our systems change, until the natural one
  is fully developed; and the question simply comes to this, Whether the
  Linn�an method should be upheld as a solitary exception to the mutability
  of human wisdom.</p>

  <p>The sun of truth must however finally prevail, and there is every
  reason to think it has already broke, and will gradually disperse these
  mists of prejudice. It is however much to be regretted, that our public
  institutions are wholly inadequate to facilitate not only the advancement
  of students, but the researches of those who are already engaged in
  prosecuting their inquiries: in Scotland alone are founded any
  Professorships of Natural History, and the establishment of our National
  Museum (in this branch only) is confessedly difficult: materials for
  study are more necessary in this science than any other; yet the public
  Institutions and libraries of the metropolis, "rich and rare" in every
  other department of knowledge, in most instances are deficient in this of
  the most elementary books; setting aside those of illustration, which,
  from being unavoidably expensive and within the reach of few purchasers,
  are more particularly adapted for such general repositories of learning.
  The protracted ill-health of its noble possessor, was the cause no doubt
  of the Banksian magnificent library being left deficient in several of
  the latest continental works; and that of the British Museum I have
  reason to think is still more defective. To the honour however of the
  keepers of the Bodleian and Radcliffe Libraries, it should be mentioned,
  that no pains or expense have been spared to render them as perfect in
  this branch as possible; and we have been told that the latter
  particularly is the most magnificent in the kingdom.</p>

  <p>We shall now as briefly as possible advert to the contents of this
  volume.</p>

  <p>In the Ornithological department the systems of Cuvier and Temminck
  have mostly superseded all others: as a whole, we give a decided
  preference to the latter, as being more natural, though it may be doubted
  if the generic distinctions are not too few, while those of Cuvier are
  too many: both however can be considered only as sketches, subject to
  improvement&mdash;as natural affinities are more studied.</p>

  <p>Regarding that part of our work which relates to Entomology, we have
  given a decided preference to the Lepidoptera, for the simple reason that
  this order has received less attention from all writers, concerning their
  real characters and affinities, than any other; indeed they have been
  most unaccountably neglected even by Latreille, the great founder of the
  modern school: we have therefore thought it necessary to propose in this
  department many new genera, and only have to regret that their
  definitions could not be made more perfect without the destruction of the
  specimens, frequently not our own, and which therefore was unattainable:
  a more extended knowledge of the natural affinities existing in this
  tribe, will alone confirm or annul the propriety of these
  distinctions.</p>

  <p>In <i>Conchology</i> many of the genera long established on the
  Continent, but new to our own collectors, have been characterized and
  illustrated, as well as specific distinctions defined between shells
  hitherto considered as varieties; and here it must be observed that so
  much latitude has been given to the meaning of the term <i>variety</i>,
  that in its general acceptation its definition becomes impossible: our
  own idea of its true meaning is, a shell possessing one or more
  characters which are changeable and uncertain, and which consequently
  will not serve as indications by which it may infallibly be distinguished
  from all others; <i>variety</i> depends on local circumstances, and
  affects the size, colour, and greater or less development of the same
  modification of structure; a <i>species</i> is permanent, its structure
  always the same though more or less developed, producing and perpetuating
  its kind, and depending on formation, discernible in youth, and matured
  in age: we cannot therefore comprehend the contradictory term of
  <i>permanent varieties</i> in a state of nature (though such occur in
  domesticated animals), which some authors have used, and which has led
  to, in many instances, the most erroneous conclusions.</p>

  <p>It is lamentable to see the opposition which is still made by our own
  writers against all the modern improvements; yet although Linn�an
  Introductions to Conchology are constantly issuing from the press, the
  desire of being acquainted with a more natural and intelligible
  classification has already appeared; and as we are frequently questioned
  on the subject, we cannot in this place do better than refer the young
  student to the valuable article on Conchology contained in the late
  supplement to the <i>Encyclopedia Britannica</i>, the perusal of which
  will convey more solid information, and less perplexity, than all the
  Introductions our booksellers can boast of.</p>

  <p>With respect to the quotations or synonyms, it should be observed that
  we have in most instances limited them only to original works, all
  doubtful ones have been rejected, and such only given as have been
  actually consulted; indeed to this latter cause must be attributed the
  occasional omission of some, existing in books we had not the immediate
  power of consulting; our own library is not small; but the difficulty and
  expense of procuring all the new continental publications, and the
  impossibility of meeting with them at our public libraries<a name="NtA_2"
  href="#Nt_2"><sup>[2]</sup></a>, may have sometimes led us into error,
  and unintentionally to have passed over the discoveries of others.</p>

  <p>With the few additions contained in the Appendix we shall now
  conclude; trusting that in the remarks drawn from us by the present state
  of the science in this country, our zeal for truth will not give us an
  appearance of want of candour or of vanity. The truth of our remarks on
  the labours of others, every one at all acquainted with the subject can
  inquire into, and either acknowledge or disprove: we neither deprecate
  nor despise criticism: an author who presumes to instruct others, should
  have his pretensions publicly canvassed, his merits admitted, or his
  deficiency exposed; no one is more sensible than we are that our own
  pretensions chiefly consist in having set an example for others more able
  to follow: and if we have in any way advocated the cause of truth and
  science, our object will be attained, and we shall then gladly retire in
  the shade.</p>

  <p>We only thoroughly identified this beautiful little bird, by an
  inspection of the costly work of Le Vaillant on this family, in the
  Banksian Library: for the description of the orange-winged Parakeet of
  Dr. Latham is not applicable; and Dr. Shaw has persisted in the old error
  of considering this species a variety of the Toui Parakeet, although the
  question had been put at rest by the original description and sound
  reasons of Le Vaillant. There is a wide difference between naturalists
  who compile, and form their theories from books, and those who study
  nature, and think for themselves; and nothing will result from the first
  but mischief to the science, and perplexity to the student.</p>

  <p>Our figure is from a specimen brought from Demerara by C. Edmonston,
  Esq.; another is in the possession of A. MacLeay, Esq. Though rare in our
  cabinets, M. Le Vaillant says it is common in Cayenne. He has given a
  beautiful figure of the female, which is entirely green.</p>

  <p>Total length six inches. Plumage above entirely green, beneath paler
  and inclining to yellow; just under the lower mandible is a small
  snuff-coloured spot, and a very narrow line of the same in front just
  above the nostrils; the quills dark-green, the greater ones on their
  outside base are blue, with which the head is also tinged. The spurious
  wings are entirely of a rich and clear orange. Inner wing-covers green.
  Quills inside greenish-blue, except on each side the shafts, where there
  is a line of black. Tail short, cuneated, hardly projecting an inch
  beyond the wings, both above and below green: the interior margin
  dirty-yellow, the feathers pointed. Bill and legs flesh-colour.</p>

  <p>The present species is one of the many interesting birds collected in
  Java by my friend Dr. Horsfield: it was not, however, until I had
  described and engraved another specimen, sent to Sir J. Banks from
  Ceylon, that I discovered the species had already been included in the
  Doctor's account of the birds of Java, presented to the Linn�an Society,
  where he has described it under the name of <i>Orthorynchus
  frontalis</i>.</p>

  <p>The specific name of its first describer is of course retained: with
  respect, however, to its generic situation, I must be allowed to dissent
  from considering it as a distinct genus, merely from the prolongation of
  the hinder toe being somewhat more developed than in <i>Sitta Europ�a</i>
  and <i>Carolinensis</i>, both which birds are now before me, and which in
  themselves differ in the relative proportion of this part: thus in <i>S.
  Carolinensis</i> the hind toe and claw is two-tenths of an inch shorter
  than the leg; in <i>S. Europ�a</i> it is one-tenth shorter; and in the
  present species it just exceeds that of the leg: in every other respect
  not the slightest difference I apprehend will be observed <span

  <p>Total length five inches. Size of the European Nuthatch. Bill, from

  velvet-black, continued in a stripe of the same colour over the eye, and
  terminating above the ear feathers: the upper plumage is of a rich blue,
  more brilliant on the head, and paler on the front, and external margins
  of the quills. Spurious wings and lesser quills black margined with blue.
  Inner wing-covers deep black; the under plumage is a light-brown,
  changing to lilac on the ears and sides of the neck, and tinged with
  cinereous on the flanks and vent: the chin is white; tail even, the two
  middle feathers blue, the rest more or less black, having the external
  margins and tips blue. The outer quill of the wings is short, the second
  and third longest and equal, the fourth rather less; the hind toe with
  the claw, measures one inch in a straight line.</p>

  <p>This unique and beautiful Mitre has been already described by Captain
  Marryat in the Linn�an Transactions: the figures, however, are
  uncoloured, and give a very indifferent idea of the graceful symmetry of
  its form. My friend Dr. Leach, with his usual liberality, permitted me to
  draw the accompanying figure of it at the British Museum, where it is now
  deposited.</p>

  <p>It appears to have been taken near Nice in the Mediterranean, adhering
  to a sounding-line, in very deep water; a very singular locality, since
  nearly all the Mitres have generally been supposed to inhabit the
  tropical seas, or at least far from the coasts of Europe. It should,
  however, be remarked, that <i>Cypr�a lurida</i>, an Asiatic shell, I have
  found on the shores of Greece: and C. Ulysses, in his travels in the
  kingdom of Naples, enumerates several shells as inhabiting the warm
  shores of the Tarentine Bay, which are generally known only as natives of
  the Red Sea and Indian Ocean. These facts, with many others, prove the
  physical distribution of <i>Mollusc�</i> to be less decidedly marked than
  almost any other class of animals.</p>

  <p>This genus is included with that of <i>Voluta</i> by Linn�us and our
  own writers, although long ago justly separated by the continental
  zoologists.</p>

  <p>The genus <i>Bulimus</i> was long ago formed by Scopoli out of the
  heterogeneous mixture of shells thrown together in the Linn�an genus
  <i>Helix</i><a name="NtA_3" href="#Nt_3"><sup>[3]</sup></a>, &amp;c.: it
  comprehends some of the larger and most beautiful of the exotic land
  shells, among which the present species will stand conspicuous both in
  beauty of colouring and excessive rarity. While travelling among the
  forests of Brazil, in the province of Bahia, I found the shell here
  figured one morning on the leaves of a <i>Solanum</i>. I not only
  searched myself, but promised as a reward to any of my Indians who would
  bring me another, a two-bladed Birmingham knife!&mdash;the greatest
  temptation they could have!&mdash;but in vain; for I never saw another
  before or since.</p>

  <p>There are many peculiar characters presented in this species
  independent of its colour: the spiral whorls are strongly plaited
  longitudinally about half their length, and marked very slightly (but
  sufficiently distinct) with several oblique indented stri�; the principal
  whorl has a row of indented and unequal sulcations near the suture, and a
  slight appearance of elevation along the white transverse band; the outer
  lip is thick, broad, and flattened beneath; but the margin is reflected
  back, and forms a prominent rim on the upper surface. The shell, when
  viewed closely, appears rough with minute scale-like elevations, very
  much resembling shagreen.</p>

<h5><img src="images/separator.png" class="middle" style="height:1.5ex;" alt="" /></h5>

  <p>The present insect is selected to illustrate a very elegant family of
  Butterflies, whose predominant tints are composed of orange, yellow, and
  white, variously blended and disposed in a greater or less degree
  throughout all the species. The generic characters above given will
  distinguish them as peculiar to the tropics, and principally those of
  South America; one or two species only being found in Africa, and five or
  six inhabiting India.</p>

  <p>I have no doubt this is the <i>Pap. Statira</i> of Cramer; it is found
  only in Brazil, and has been erroneously considered by Godart and
  Latreille as a variety of <i>C. Jugurthina</i>, an Indian insect, and
  which in fact is not in itself a species, being no other than the female
  of <i>C. Alcmeone</i>, as an attentive examination of a vast number of
  both, collected in Java by Dr. Horsfield, enabled me to ascertain.</p>

  <p>The extraordinary prolongation of the last joint of the palpi, and the
  white borderless spots beneath, which are never silvered, will
  distinguish this species through all the variations; in the ground colour
  of its wings, which in no two specimens are exactly alike, and one before
  me is nearly white; the lesser snowy dot is sometimes very obscure, and
  often wanting; but the prolongation of the palpi is even expressed in
  Cramer's figure above quoted.</p>

  <p>I have examined about a dozen specimens, mostly captured by myself,
  and all have been females; and I strongly suspect future and more decided
  observations will prove <i>C. Evadne</i> to be the other sex: it has the
  palpi lengthened, though in a less degree; and the articulations of the
  antenn� in both insects will be found somewhat thickened at their
  termination when viewed under a magnifier, a peculiarity I have seen in
  no other species; and although I have examined near thirty specimens of
  <i>C. Evadne</i>, they have invariably proved to be males.</p>

  <p>The palpi in this insect will be found at variance with the generic
  character now given; a striking proof that in a natural system no single
  part can be taken as an unerring criterion for generic distinction,
  without making it eventually an artificial one. The <i>Colias Drya</i> of
  Fabricius has the same formation of palpi, but is a totally different
  insect.</p>

  <p>In size this insect is the largest of the genus yet discovered; it was

  valued friend, Dr. W. E. Leach, of the British Museum, whose talents are
  too well known to need any eulogium in this place.</p>

  <p>It appears to inhabit both the northern and southern extremities of
  Brazil; for I have seen it in a box sent from Par�, and my specimens were
  captured in Minas Geraes by my friend Dr. Langsdorff. It is, however, a
  rare species; for I have only seen seven or eight specimens, and they
  were all males: the female, when found, will probably differ as
  remarkably as in most of this genus.</p>

  <p>The opaque spot on the inferior wings above is very large; but the
  tuft of hair corresponding beneath the superior wings, is entirely
  wanting. It should be likewise observed, that although this insect in
  every outward respect resembles a genuine <i>Colias</i> (the type of
  which may be <i>C. Ebule</i>), it differs very materially in the terminal
  appendages of the abdomen; the last joint being the shortest, and
  scarcely pointed; and the hook, instead of being concealed beneath this
  segment, is exserted beyond it, and met by two others, one at the base of
  each lateral valve: these valves are also much shorter, ovate, and not
  attenuated, although ending in an incurved hook. In the present ignorance
  in which a true knowledge of the Lepidoptera is involved, it is
  impossible to say how far these dissimilarities may point out natural
  groups; it is therefore of the highest importance to the science such
  facts should be noticed.</p>
